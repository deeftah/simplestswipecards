# Simplest Swipe Cards  *By [Michael Sitver](http://www.Michaelsitver.com)*

# Introduction:
These are the simplest, most beautiful Tinder swipe cards on the web. They don't require Node.JS, or React, or hosting a new stylesheet, or anything of the sort. **You can literally copy/paste them onto your existing static website**.

They're also extremely lightweight.

# Stack:
They're written in:
- HTML
- JS (with a smattering of Jquery)
- And CSS
That's it!

There are a few small dependencies, but they're all hosted for free on solid CDNs, and well-supported on StackOverflow:
- JQuery, JqueryUI, and JQuery Mobile (the magic that makes these work)
- FontAwesome - optional, but included (for the two icons)
